# Description
You can download the required folder for this task. The folder includes two files called `1.txt` and `2.txt`. 

After the user specifies an operation, the program should read the numbers from `1.txt` and `2.txt` and apply the operation on each corresponding number from the `1.txt` and `2.txt` files. The results should be stored in the corresponding lines of a new file called `result.txt`.

For-example, if the user enters the operator `+`, the numbers in the first lines of `1.txt` and `2.txt` will be added (`925 + 789 = 1714`) , the result will be store in the first line of a new file called `result.txt`. Same should happen for the remaining lines.

### Hints
> Hint 1: Use `File.ReadAllLines` to read `1.txt` and `2.txt`
> Hint 2: `StreamWriter` will be used in writing the output file.
